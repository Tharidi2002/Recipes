    <h1><u>Chicken Broth in Instant Pot</u></h1>
    <p>
        The tastiest and most versatile chicken broth is the simplest one you can make. It shouldn’t require a lot of
        ingredients, and the small number of ingredients do not take away from its awesome taste. This recipe is just that! It
        is ready in 15 minutes and can be used for so many dishes.

        You are probably used to seeing my recipes with step-by-step photos. I had a little fiasco in the photographing universe
        and only have the final photo of this chicken broth. Don’t despair though, I make this recipe every other week and next
        time I will update the recipe for you with all the photos needed. There is also a reason why I didn’t wait until I took
        another set of photos. I made this awesome “white pilaf”- beyaz pilav, or chicken pilaf where the chicken broth
        (specifically the home-made one) is one of the important ingredients. I wanted to give you a reference for the chicken
        broth, hence I created this small, to the point recipe post. Oh, another thing this recipe is DEAD easy! Like I probably
        can write the whole thing in one sentence. That might just happen, too!
        <br><br>
        For a good chicken broth, you don’t necessarily need a specific part of the chicken. I’ve made broth with thigh meat,
        chicken breast, bones, etc. Just grab whatever you have in the refrigerator. I also use instant pot to expedite the
        process. Without Instant Pot you will need to cook the soup a little longer. If you have an IP kudos to you. I love them
        so much, I have two. Heck, If I had more room in my pantry, I would probably get a third one, too!

    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb of chicken (any part)</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 small carrot</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3L water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Directions:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the chicken, place in the Instant Pot, add 1/2 onion (without slicing), add peeled whole carrot, garlic cloves,
        salt and pour the water into the pot. Try not to add more salt to the broth than I directed. It is best to season the
        broth depending on what you are going to use it for later.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Making sure that the seal is properly installed, close the lid of the Instant Pot. Close the release valve and press
        MANUAL on the IP. Making sure the pressure is set to HIGH, set the IP to 15 minutes. If you are not using the Instant
        Pot or any pressure cooker, bring the water to boil, turn the heat down and simmer for 30 minutes. You will also need to
        add more water because it will evaporate a little during the simmering process.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the timer is up, turn the IP down and manually release the pressure by turning the valve to “pressure release”.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Discard all the vegetables. If I added meat I will keep it and use it up for sauteing or for some salads. No need to
        discard perfectly good ingredient. For that matter, you can keep and use the vegetables, too. Onions? not so much.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cool the broth down and refrigerated or continue using the broth for your next recipe.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>
        This is pretty much it!
