    <h1><u>Chicken Pilaf Recipe</u></h1>
    <p>Chicken pilaf is a Turkish rice dish. However simple, don’t underestimate this recipe. In my opinion, the simplest
    recipes actually leave the best impressions. Thanks to the chicken broth, the rice turns out delicious.</p>

        Turkish cuisine is notorious for its Beyaz Pilav – White Pilaf. It may seem like just basic white rice, but I have
        always loved eating if it is prepared correctly. Namely, it is always better to use either beef broth or chicken broth
        instead of just plain water. Granted that making a broth is such an easy task, you might as well give some flavor to
        your rice. Children seem to love this pilaf more than anyone. Especially my kiddos. Since they love giving me their
        feedback on things I prepare for my family, here is what they had to say about this particular recipe.
        <br><br>
        Omar: Mom, make sure to write to your readers to spare some broth to serve as a side or pour over the dish before
        serving. This prevents the rice from drying a bit.
        <br><br>
        Ozzy: Mommy, the fried onions are definitely a good addition to the dish. It gives that caramel taste to the rice, which
        I really like.

    <h3>Let’s talk about rice</h3>

    <p>
        There are so many different types of rice and not all of them take the same amount of water or the same amount of
        cooking time. I can only recommend you to choose what might work. However, you may not be able to find the same exact
        brand. Please use the rice you know well in case there is no other choice. I am using Royal basmati rice for this time
        around. It is more or less available in the U.S. supermarkets.
        <br><br>
        If you do not have iRoyal Basmati, Jasmine rice will work, too. If you wish to use something closer to the authentic
        Turkish rice, then your best bet is medium-grained rice like California Rose (Calrose) or Botan. However, I find the
        rice with the least amount of starch works better for this particular recipe. Some type of basmati, which does not have
        a strong smell or taste to it should work.

    <h3>Let’s talk about chicken</h3>
    <p>
        I use boiled chicken as I find it most suitable. Specifically, I use the chicken I make chicken broth from. You can also
        boil the chicken specifically for this recipe or use baked chicken if you have any. Try to sauté raw chicken pieces with
        some onions before adding them to the rice. That will work, too. Experiment and see what will come out of it. The aim of
        the recipe is to be able to use the boiled/cooked chicken and I like it that way. Perhaps, I will leave the sautéing
        chicken for the next recipe.

    <h3>Let’s talk about chicken broth</h3>
    <p>
        I posted a <a href="/pages/chicken-broth.html" target="_blank"> <mark>chicken broth</mark> </a> recipe to go along with chicken pilaf. Click on the link to learn how to make broth. Prior to
        starting this recipe, you can boil some chicken, with onion and some spices. It will not take you a long time, I
        promise.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of rice</li>
        <li>1 cup of short vermicelli or orzo pasta</li>
        <li>5 cups of chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 lbs boiled chicken (baked, grilled, a sautéed chicken will work, too)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp clarified butter or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cup cooked or canned garbanzo beans</li>
        <li>1 medium onion + 1/4 cup oil (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Directions:</strong>
    <p>Above is the photo of the vermicelli I use. However, you can sub it to orzo pasta if you have a hard time finding
    shortly cut vermicelli. Both are interchangeably used in Turkish cuisine. Also pictured my chicken broth for this
    recipe. As I mentioned above you can use a store-bought version, too.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Shred or cut cooked chicken and set it aside.</li><br><br>
        <li>Wash rice until water comes out almost clear. Set aside to be used shortly.</li><br><br>
        <li>Add olive oil and clarified butter in a large frying pan or a large pot. Turn the heat on to medium-high.</li><br><br>
        <li>Add vermicelli and start cooking it by continuously mixing it. The vermicelli will be ready very quickly. Don’t go
        anywhere far. Saute the vermicelli until they turn brown.</li><br><br>
        <li>Quickly add washed rice and mix everything well. Make sure all the rice gets coated with oil. Add 2 tsp salt and saute
        the rice for another 1 minute.</li><br><br>
        <li>Add chicken broth into the pot and bring it to boil. Add garbanzo beans and cook down the chicken broth until there is
        slight moisture remaining. Do not completely dry out the mixture.</li><br><br>
        <li>Add shredded chicken into the pot and mix everything well.</li><br><br>
        <li>Turn the heat down to simmer and cover the lid of the pot. Depending on the rice you are using and how much water it may
        take to fully cook, this process could take from 15-25 minutes. Royal basmati cooks pretty quickly apparently and it
        only took me about 15 minutes or a little less.</li><br><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, slice 1/2 onion and caramelize it in 1/4 cup oil. This step is completely optional. However, crispy onions
        taste amazing with this pilaf. If you need step-by-step instructions for caramelized, crispy onions, <a href="/pages/caramelize-onions.html" target="_blank"><mark>click here</mark></a>.</li><br><br>
        <li>Once 15 minutes have passed, turn the heat off from under the pot. Give your pilaf a nice stir and get it ready to be
        served. As my boys mentioned above, having some extra chicken broth is a good idea to serve alongside the pilaf.</li><br><br>
    </ol>
