    <h1><u>How To Caramelize Onions</u></h1>
    <p>
        This is a quick “how to”explaining how to caramelize onions. There are many instances when caramelized onions are used
        while cooking. The process itself is quite easy. However, there are certain details I would want you to pay attention
        to.

    <p>
        This particular method of caramelizing onions (crispy) is a good addition to Middle Eastern food, Asian soups, salads,
        rice dishes and many more. Should you require a creamier version of the caramelized onions to go on top of pasta, quiche
        all you have to do is add some water and a tad bit of apple cider vinegar right before you are done with the cooking.
        The step will render somewhat hydrated caramelized onions and will be a good addition to sandwiches, soups, and many
        other dishes.

    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>medium onion, sliced</li> 
        <li>1 TBSP butter or clarified butter</li>
        <li>1 TBP liquid oil (high-temperature cooking)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2TBSP apple vinegar (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Directions:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>For the number of onions I have, I only need a medium skillet. Turn the heat on medium and place the skillet on the
        cooktop. Add butter and liquid oil.</li><br>
        <li>Add sliced onions and gently stir them and spread out evenly on the surface of the skillet. Keep the heat on medium
        until the onions soften and get translucent. Don’t forget to occasionally stir.</li><br>
        <li>Once the onions are translucent and somewhat cooked down, turn the heat up a notch. Let the onions keep on cooking, all
        the while stirring it occasionally.</li><br>
        <li>As soon as you notice some color golden color developing in the onions, stirring should become a little more frequent so
        that the thinner onion strands do not get burned. Try to flip the bottom onions to the top, and uncooked strands back to
        the bottom of the skillet.</li><br>
        <li>Once the desired color and crispiness has reached, turn the heat off and TAKE the skillet off from the cooktop, too.
        Since the skillet and the oils are still hot, onions will keep on cooking even after being removed from the cooktop. The
        best bet is to transfer the onions into another dish and keep it aside until further use.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>

    <h3>Optional step for softer onions</h3>
    <p>
        Once the desired color and crispiness has reached, turn the heat down to medium-low and add 1/4 cup water and 1/2 TBSP
        apple cider vinegar. Stir the liquids in very quickly and let the onions soak up the moisture and cook for another 3-4
        minutes.
